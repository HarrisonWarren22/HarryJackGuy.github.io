        <p>I have chosen to make a limp biz kit song.    I have been inspired by the 2000 album.    The chocolate starfish and the hot dog flavored water.     This album is nu metal.     The bass appeals to me.    I have watched many videos of them doing a show.  One video that comes to mind is Wood Stock 1999.   At wood stock 99 they started with break stuff.   The crowd went crazy.  400,000 people saw limp biz kit n the 24 th July 1999. The atmosphere was immense. That’s the reason I picked limp biz kit.    https://amp.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/01/woodstock-99-full-metal-racket-the-jaw-dropping-story-of-a-disastrous-music-festival     https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/limp-bizkit  </p>
