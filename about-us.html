        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>In January 2023 Me, Jack and Ewan decided to start a group. We decided on the name Left 4 Dead. We discussed he possibility of a EP. I Conducted lots of research on how to produce and make a EP, as a group we choose our own infulences. Limp Bizkit, Marlyin Manson, Call me karizma and Bring Me The Horizon. These are the infulences for the EP. We are producing 4 tracks based around these artists. The group are adding our own creative touch to these tracks. The 4 songs are all original. Jack is the vocalist and songs writer. Ewan is the lead guitarist and writes riffs. I'm the bassist and I write baslines. We had all worked very hard to create unquie music for this E. We are going to release an EP on the 23rd of June 2023. </p>
