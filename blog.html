        <h1>20/04/2023</h1>
        <p>The target was to use Ewan's riff to create a song. The outcome was a metal style lofi track with guitar and drums we also figured out a few lyrics. The song is done in basic form. It needs mixing.</p>
    </div>

        <h1>24/04/2023</h1>
        <p>The target was to perfect the song from the 20th. The outcome is in video form. We also created a chill stlye song in the drum room. We used the baseline that Jack made. Jack made the drums with Ewan. The song has no title as of yet.</p>
    </div>

        <h1>26/04/2023</h1>
        <p>The target was to finally record a song for the EP. The outcome was an indie lofi style song with melody and chords plus a looped temp beat. We also put a melodic riff on top with a tone of reverb which is added to lofi ambience we tried to emulate.</p>
    </div>

        <h1>27/04/2023</h1>
        <p>Target was to record some guitar and then use logic pro to create a beat and add some synth. The outcome was a more rock style indie beat with lofi undertone. We started with chords by putting a capo on the 4th fret then use a progression of C, E, Am, and F which created a moody stlye indie song. Ewan then added a solo over the top to add more life to it. We also experimented with different sounds we could make just using the guitar and the effects, Jack added a riff just before Ewan's and also made a sound using a hammer on and reverb and tremolo. This helped create a more layered tracj which me and Ewan were happy with. Jack also experimented and created a pop punk style track. Jack used a power riff over the top. I Then programmed a punk/club style beat over the top to add more energy. Jack was hoping to convey. Harrison was off.</p>

        <h1>04/05/2023</h1>
        <p>The taregt was to get 2 songs recorded. We started with the song sweet dreams by Marilyn Manson as our foundation. Jack recorded the basic chords into the focusrite and the me and Ewan both added 2 riffs each. One with effects and one without. I recorded my bass which we had 3 takes for (we decided that the second one was the most in time so we went with that one) Jack and Ewan then programmed a trap beat for the verses. We didn't get the vocals done.</p>
    </div>

        <h1>10/05/2023</h1>
        <p>Today's target was to create a new song as Harrison wasnt in. Jack and Ewan decided to go back to the more lofi style of track we had been experimenting with. Jack created the chords and Ewan created the main melodic riff. We used a temp beat as we ran out of time.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h1>11/05/2023</h1>
        <p>The target was to carry on with the metal drum n bass track. The session went well, however we decided to scrap the track off the EP. We instead started a more Lil Peep inspired track. We looked at the songs: your favourite dress and spotlight as out inspiration. Ewan came up with a guitar chord progression combined with a meoldic riff layered and Jack programmed the drums. We talked abour reversing the guitar at the start and having a sample of a women crying. We went on YouTube for the sample which we converted to mp3 format, we used a focusrite to record the guitar into logic and then copied the track and recorded session into copy to reverse the guitar on one of the tracks but also keep the original recording how it was. Jack then decided to edit the main drum section to a more Lil Peep inspired sound. Harrison was off.</p>

        <h1>17/05/2023</h1>
        <p>The target was to finish the pop punk track. We recorded the bass and mastered the track with allan showing us how to, but decided to wait to add vocals. However, we did decide to get vocals done for sweet dreams which we used parallel compression and a direction filter to achieve. Jack also looked up how to master tracks i looked at how to stay in time on the bass.</p>
    </div>

        <h1>18/05/2023</h1>
        <p>The plan was to start a new track inpsired by Limp Bizkit and to master the mix on sweet dreams so we could commercially release the song. Jack and i looked at take a look around by Limp Bizkit and Break stuff by Limp Bizkit to see what sort of instumental structure the song had. Production notes .beat is a more rock inspired beat with hi hat and less snare. .breakdown is heavier than verses. The guitar lead had interesting effects added. middle section uses more toms and no snare. vocals had heavy distortion and reverb on during this section. We started on the track but didnt really like it worked and we had problems with the mixing desk when trying to record which Allan helped to fix. We came up with the baseline and some chords that worked but couldn't get any further with the track. I chose to make the Limp Bizkit track.</p>

        <p>The plan was to work on the Limp Bizkit stlye track. We ended up mastering 2 more tracks and decided to scrap Limp Bizkit. We looked at the house of wolves by bring me the horizon. We finished everything on sweet dream and rock project.</p>
