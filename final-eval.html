        <h1>My Final Evaluation</h1>
        <p>
In the last 2 months I have learned so much about music.   I learned how to play bass and read music tabs.  I’m happy that I have found an instrument that I enjoy to play.  Also, I’m happy that I put the effort in to practicing lots for this project. Me and our band played live together for the first time.   We all have a unique connection while we make music together.  We have all  been busy practicing and working on this project.   The band has put countless hours into this EP project.    I’m very grateful for Jack and Ewan for helping me with bass tabs at the beginning.   We have all helped each other along the way.   I’m happy for being apart of this project EP.     I’m hoping to make music again with these creative artists again.  </p>
